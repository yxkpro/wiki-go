LeoMoon Wiki-Go is a modern, feature-rich, databaseless flat-file wiki platform built with Go. It provides a clean, intuitive interface for creating and managing knowledge bases, documentation, and collaborative content without requiring any external database.

## Important Configuration Note with Non-SSL Setups

If you're running LeoMoon Wiki-Go without SSL/HTTPS and experiencing login issues, you need to set ` + "`allow_insecure_cookies: true`" + ` in your ` + "`config.yaml`" + ` file. This is because:

1. By default, LeoMoon Wiki-Go sets the "Secure" flag on cookies for security
2. Browsers reject "Secure" cookies on non-HTTPS connections
3. This prevents login from working properly on HTTP-only setups

> **Security Note**: Only use this setting in development or in trusted internal networks. For public-facing wikis, always use HTTPS.

## Customization

### Custom Favicon

LeoMoon Wiki-Go comes with default favicons, but you can easily replace them with your own:

1. To use custom favicons, place your files in the ` + "`data/static/`" + ` directory with the following names:
   - ` + "`favicon.ico`" + ` - Standard favicon format (used by older browsers)
   - ` + "`favicon.png`" + ` - PNG format favicon
   - ` + "`favicon.svg`" + ` - SVG format favicon (recommended for best quality at all sizes)

2. The application will automatically detect and use your custom favicon files without requiring a restart.

SVG format is recommended for favicons as it scales well to different sizes while maintaining crisp quality.

### Custom Logo (Optional)

You can add a custom logo to display in the sidebar above your wiki title:

1. Create a logo file in one of the supported formats:
   - ` + "`logo.svg`" + ` - SVG format (recommended for best quality)
   - ` + "`logo.png`" + ` - PNG format (alternative option)

2. Place the logo file in the ` + "`data/static/`" + ` directory.

3. The logo will automatically appear in the sidebar above your wiki title.

**Notes:**
- The logo is displayed at 120×120 pixels, but will maintain its aspect ratio
- SVG format is recommended for the best appearance at all screen sizes
- No configuration changes or application restart needed
- If no logo file is present, only the wiki title will be displayed
- If both logo.svg and logo.png exist, logo.svg will be used

### Global Banner (Optional)

You can add a banner image that will appear at the top of all documents:

1. Create a banner image in one of the supported formats:
   - ` + "`banner.png`" + ` - PNG format (recommended for best quality)
   - ` + "`banner.jpg`" + ` - JPG format (alternative option)

2. Place the banner file in the ` + "`data/static/`" + ` directory.

3. The banner will automatically appear at the top of all document content.

**Notes:**
- The banner is displayed with responsive width and a maximum height of 250px
- The banner maintains its aspect ratio while fitting different screen sizes
- No configuration changes or application restart needed
- To remove the banner, simply delete the file from the ` + "`data/static/`" + ` directory
- If both banner.png and banner.jpg exist, banner.png will be used

## Security

## Markdown Guide

LeoMoon Wiki-Go uses Markdown for formatting content. Here are some examples:

### Headings
| Markdown                | Rendered Output          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| \# Heading level 1      | <h1>Heading level 1</h1> |
| \## Heading level 2     | <h2>Heading level 2</h2> |
| \### Heading level 3    | <h3>Heading level 3</h3> |
| \#### Heading level 4   | <h4>Heading level 4</h4> |
| \##### Heading level 5  | <h5>Heading level 5</h5> |
| \###### Heading level 6 | <h6>Heading level 6</h6> |

### Paragraphs
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

### Line Breaks
To create a line break or new line (<br\>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

### Emphasis
You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

#### Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

| Markdown                   | Rendered Output        |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Example \*\*bold\*\* text. | Example **bold** text. |
| Example \_\_bold\_\_ text. | Example __bold__ text. |
| Example\*\*bold\*\*text    | Example**bold**text    |

#### Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

| Markdown                     | Rendered Output            |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Example \*italicized\* text. | Example *italicized* text. |
| Example \_italicized\_ text. | Example _italicized_ text. |
| Example\*italicized\*text    | Example*italicized*text    |

#### Bold and Italic
To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

| Markdown                                      | Rendered Output                         |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| This text is \*\*\*really important\*\*\*.    | This text is ***really important***.    |
| This text is \_\_\_really important\_\_\_.    | This text is ___really important___.    |
| This text is \_\_\*really important\*\_\_.    | This text is __*really important*__.    |
| This text is \*\*\_really important\_\*\*.    | This text is **_really important_**.    |
| This is really\*\*\*very\*\*\*important text. | This is really***very***important text. |

### Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
` + "```text" + `
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
` + "```" + `
The rendered output looks like this:
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

#### Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs
Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.
` + "``` text" + `
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
` + "```" + `
The rendered output looks like this:
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

#### Nested Blockquotes
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.
` + "```text" + `
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
` + "```" + `
The rendered output looks like this:
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

#### Blockquotes with Other Elements
Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you'll need to experiment to see which ones work.
` + "```text" + `
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
` + "```" + `
The rendered output looks like this:
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

#### Lists and Task Lists

##### Regular Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. You can also nest lists to create sub-items.

**Unordered Lists** use asterisks (` + "`*`" + `), plus signs (` + "`+`" + `), or hyphens (` + "`-`" + `):

- Item 1
  - Sub-item 1
  - Sub-item 2
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 1
    - Sub-sub-item 1
    - Sub-sub-item 2
  - Sub-item 2
- Item 3

**Ordered Lists** use numbers followed by a period:

1. First item
   - Sub-item 1
   - Sub-item 2
2. Second item
   1. Sub-item 1
   2. Sub-item 2
3. Third item

You can also mix ordered and unordered lists:

1. First item
   - Sub-item 1
   - Sub-item 2
2. Second item
   - Sub-item 1
     1. Sub-sub-item 1
     2. Sub-sub-item 2
   - Sub-item 2
3. Third item

##### Task Lists

Markdown supports task lists, which are useful for tracking tasks or to-do items. Use square brackets to denote the state of each task: ` + "`[x]`" + ` for completed tasks and ` + "`[ ]`" + ` for incomplete tasks. Task lists can also include nested items.

**Example Task List:**

- [x] Write the press release
  - [x] Draft
  - [x] Review
  - [x] Finalize
- [ ] Update the website
  - [ ] Update home page
  - [ ] Update contact information

This task list shows that the press release has been fully completed, while the website update and media contact tasks are still pending with some sub-tasks.

### Extended Syntax
These are extended markdown features in LeoMoon Wiki-Go.

#### Text Highlight
To ==highlight text==, add two equal signs before and after a word or phrase. To highlight the middle of a word for emphasis, add two equal signs without spaces around the letters.

#### Superscript and Subscript
To create superscript text in Markdown, use the caret symbol (` + "`^`" + `). For example, ` + "`1^st^`" + ` renders as 1^st^. For subscript text, use the tilde symbol (` + "`~`" + `). For instance, ` + "`h~2~o`" + ` renders as h~2~o.

#### Strikethrough

To create strikethrough text in Markdown, use double tildes (` + "`~~`" + `). For example, ` + "`~~incorrect~~`" + ` renders as ~~incorrect~~.

#### Typographic Shortcodes
- ` + "`(c)`" + `: Replaced with (c) (Copyright symbol).
- ` + "`(r)`" + `: Replaced with (r) (Registered trademark symbol).
- ` + "`(tm)`" + `: Replaced with (tm) (Trademark symbol).
- ` + "`(p)`" + `: Replaced with (p) (Paragraph symbol).
- ` + "`+-`" + `: Replaced with +- (Plus-minus symbol).
- ` + "`...`" + `: Replaced with ... (Ellipsis).
- ` + "`1/2`" + `: Replaced with 1/2 (One-half).
- ` + "`1/4`" + `: Replaced with 1/4 (One-quarter).
- ` + "`3/4`" + `: Replaced with 3/4 (Three-quarters).

### Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

### Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.

### Math Equations (MathJax)

Inline math: $E=mc^2$

Block math (requires blank lines before and after):

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}
$$

### Diagrams (Mermaid)

` + "```mermaid" + `
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
` + "```" + `

### Details/Summary (Collapsible Content)

You can create collapsible sections using the details code fence:

` + "```details Details Title" + `
This is the collapsible content that will be hidden by default.

You can include any Markdown content here:
- Lists
- **Bold text**
- [Links](https://example.com)
- And more...
` + "```" + `

### Video Embedding

You can embed videos from various sources:

#### YouTube Videos:
` + "```youtube" + `
LcuvxJNIgfE
` + "```" + `

#### Vimeo Videos:
` + "```vimeo" + `
92060047
` + "```" + `

#### Local MP4 Files:

After uploading a video file through the attachments feature, you can insert it using files tab:
~~~
` + "```mp4" + `
your-video-filename.mp4
` + "```" + `
~~~

#### Forced RTL/LTR
You can force a specific direction for a section of text by adding the direction shortcode:
` + "```rtl" + `
Force RTL text.
` + "```" + `

### Shortcodes

LeoMoon Wiki-Go supports special shortcodes for dynamic content:

**Statistics Shortcode**:
` + "```" + `
:::stats count=*:::

:::stats recent=5:::
` + "```" + `

These shortcodes display document statistics like total count or recent changes.
