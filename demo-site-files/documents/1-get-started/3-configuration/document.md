# Configuration

## Basic Settings

Configuration is stored in `data/config.yaml` and will be created automatically on first run with default values. You can modify this file to customize your wiki:

```yaml
server:
    host: 0.0.0.0
    port: 8080
    # When set to true, allows cookies to be sent over non-HTTPS connections.
    # WARNING: Only enable this in trusted environments like a homelab
    # where HTTPS is not available. This reduces security by allowing
    # cookies to be transmitted in plain text.
    allow_insecure_cookies: true
    # Enable native TLS. When true, application will run over HTTPS using the
    # supplied certificate and key paths.
    ssl: false

## Customization

### Custom Favicon

LeoMoon Wiki-Go comes with default favicons, but you can easily replace them with your own:

1. To use custom favicons, place your files in the `data/static/` directory with the following names:
   - `favicon.ico` - Standard favicon format (used by older browsers)
   - `favicon.png` - PNG format favicon
   - `favicon.svg` - SVG format favicon (recommended for best quality at all sizes)

2. The application will automatically detect and use your custom favicon files without requiring a restart.

SVG format is recommended for favicons as it scales well to different sizes while maintaining crisp quality.

### Custom Logo (Optional)

You can add a custom logo to display in the sidebar above your wiki title:

1. Create a logo file in one of the supported formats:
   - `logo.svg` - SVG format (recommended for best quality)
   - `logo.png` - PNG format (alternative option)

2. Place the logo file in the `data/static/` directory.

3. The logo will automatically appear in the sidebar above your wiki title.

**Notes:**
- The logo is displayed at 120×120 pixels, but will maintain its aspect ratio
- SVG format is recommended for the best appearance at all screen sizes
- No configuration changes or application restart needed
- If no logo file is present, only the wiki title will be displayed
- If both logo.svg and logo.png exist, logo.svg will be used

### Global Banner (Optional)

You can add a banner image that will appear at the top of all documents:

1. Create a banner image in one of the supported formats:
   - `banner.png` - PNG format (recommended for best quality)
   - `banner.jpg` - JPG format (alternative option)

2. Place the banner file in the `data/static/` directory.

3. The banner will automatically appear at the top of all document content.

**Notes:**
- The banner is displayed with responsive width and a maximum height of 250px
- The banner maintains its aspect ratio while fitting different screen sizes
- No configuration changes or application restart needed
- To remove the banner, simply delete the file from the `data/static/` directory
- If both banner.png and banner.jpg exist, banner.png will be used

## User Management

LeoMoon Wiki-Go includes a user management system with different permission levels:

- **Admin users**: Can create, edit, and delete content, manage users, and change settings
- **Regular users**: Can view content (when in private mode)

The default admin credentials are:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

It's recommended to change these credentials immediately after first login.
